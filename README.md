## About the TreeMenuList component

The `TreeMenuList` component provides a hierarchical list of options for selection. Each option may include a nested list of sub-options, allowing for flexible, multi-level structures.

See the TreeMenuList running live [here](https://axis68.github.io/tree-menu-list/).

### Definition of options

Each option is characterized by:
* `key`: A unique identifier
* `label`: The text to be displayed
* `subOptions` (optional): A list of nested options

#### Example:
```javascript
const options = [
  { index: "1", label: "Option 1"},
  { index: "2", label: "Option 2", subOptions: [ 
    { index: "2.1", label: "Suboption 2.1"},
    { index: "2.2", label: "Suboption 2.2"},
  ]},
  { index: "3", label: "Option 3", subOptions: [ 
    { index: "3.1", label: "Suboption 3.1"},
    { index: "3.2", label: "Suboption 3.2"},
  ]},
];
```

### Behavior

* **Expand/Collapse Sub-Options**: Sub-options can be expanded or collapsed using a `ToggleButton`. The button displays an arrow pointing to the right when collapsed or downward when expanded.
* **Default State**: By default, only the sub-options required to display the selected option are expanded. All other options are collapsed.

## Expected Props

The `TreeMenuList` expects the following props:

- **`options`**: The list of available options.
- **`selectedOption`**: The currently selected option (identified by its `index`).
- **`onChange`**: A callback invoked when a new option is selected. The selected option is passed as an argument.

### Remarks

- **Centralized State Management**:  
  The `expandedOptions` are managed centrally in the componentâ€™s state. This ensures that any levels expanded or collapsed by the user remain in memory.

- **Limitations**:  
  - Keyboard support is not yet implemented.  
  - Mouse and touch interactions could be improved.  
  - The component could be extended to support custom render functions or additional features.
  - Tests are not developped yet.
